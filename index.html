                            Anyways, you're here because you checked the link c: One of the things that i want to do all my life is make you happy, i wanna be the first man and the last who gives you flowers, i've always wanted to give you flowers,
                             but im not there to do it in person in this actual moment, These flowers are a reflection of the happines you bring to my life, thanks for lighting up my life with your presence my love ♥, i wanted to be thoughtful about this, so i've got the idea of making them 
                             for you, maybe its not too much for you or for me i dont know, but i just got in mind this thing you told me that "actions speak
                              louder than words", you can come to this secret place and remember that whenever you feel alone, remember that these flowers are part of me and im there with you, you're my biggest inspiration on everything, so i devote you this and i want you to take care of it
                               (like if it was real), but i want you to keep my promise until we get together and i can give you flowers in person as you really deserve my love, I really hope you liked it :D.
